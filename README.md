GuShot (Guide User Shot) takes the screenshots for a web app's user guide. You describe the pages, logins, and clicks in one JSON file, run one command, and get every image at the same size, with sensitive data blurred and the relevant buttons highlighted. When the UI changes, rerun it instead of redoing the screenshots by hand.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge (found automatically; otherwise set `CHROME_PATH`)
- The web app you want to capture, running somewhere the browser can reach (usually a local dev server with sample data)

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Quick start

Get the code and install the one dependency (`puppeteer-core`, which drives your existing Chrome; it does not download a browser):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rombyar/gushot.git
cd gushot
npm install --omit=dev --prefix skills/guide-screenshots/scripts
```

Try it on the demo app that ships with the repo:

```bash
cd demo
DEMO_PASSWORD=demo node ../skills/guide-screenshots/scripts/shot.cjs gushot.json
```

```
OK    screenshots/01_login.png
OK    screenshots/02_dashboard.png
OK    screenshots/03_new_order.png
OK    screenshots/04_mobile.png

Done: 4 OK, 0 failed. Output in /path/to/gushot/demo/screenshots
```

The images are in `demo/screenshots/`; [demo/README.md](demo/README.md) explains each step of that config. On Windows PowerShell, set the variable first: `$env:DEMO_PASSWORD='demo'`, then run the same `node` command.

## Writing a config

A config has three parts:

- **`sessions`**: how to log in, as a list of steps. Each session runs once and the logged-in tab is reused by every shot that names it.
- **`shots`**: the screenshots, in guide order. Each shot opens a `url`, optionally runs more `steps` (open a menu, fill a form), and saves `<name>.png`.
- **Settings** at the top: the app's `base` URL, the output folder, the viewport size, and what to blur on every page.

```json
{
  "base": "http://localhost:3000",
  "out": "screenshots",
  "alwaysBlur": [".customer-name", ".phone"],
  "sessions": {
    "admin": [
      { "open": "/login" },
      { "type": "#email", "text": "admin@example.com" },
      { "type": "#password", "text": "{{APP_PASSWORD}}" },
      { "click": "button[type=submit]" },
      { "wait": "nav" }
    ]
  },
  "shots": [
    { "name": "01_login", "url": "/login", "highlight": ["button[type=submit]"] },
    { "name": "02_dashboard", "session": "admin", "url": "/dashboard" },
    {
      "name": "03_new_order",
      "session": "admin",
      "url": "/orders",
      "steps": [{ "clickText": "New order" }, { "wait": ".modal" }],
      "element": ".modal"
    }
  ]
}
```

What you will use most:

| In a shot | Does |
|---|---|
| `highlight` | draws a red box around the elements a guide step talks about; `{ "selector": "#save", "label": "2" }` adds a numbered badge |
| `blur` | blurs extra elements in this shot (`alwaysBlur` does it for every shot) |
| `element` | captures only one element, such as a modal or a form; add `"padding": 16` to keep some of the page around it |
| `fullPage` | captures the whole scrolling page |
| `viewport` | uses another size for this shot, e.g. `{ "width": 390, "height": 844 }` for a phone |

| Step | Example |
|---|---|
| open a page | `{ "open": "/settings" }` |
| type | `{ "type": "#email", "text": "a@b.c" }` |
| click | `{ "click": "#save" }` or by visible text: `{ "clickText": "Save" }` |
| wait | `{ "wait": ".modal" }` (selector) or `{ "wait": 1000 }` (ms) |
| one-time code | `{ "otp": { "file": "logs/app.log", "pattern": "code: (\\d{6})", "into": "#otp" } }` |

The OTP step reads the newest code from a file your app writes in development (a log or mail log), so logins with two-factor codes work without a phone.

Selectors are normal CSS selectors. Paths in the config, like `out` and `otp.file`, are relative to the config file.

**Secrets:** never write passwords in the config. `{{APP_PASSWORD}}` is replaced with the `APP_PASSWORD` environment variable when the config is loaded.

Every key and step, including `select`, `press`, `scrollTo`, `hide`, `theme`, and running a shell command before a shot: [REFERENCE.md](skills/guide-screenshots/references/REFERENCE.md). A larger example with OTP: [config.example.json](skills/guide-screenshots/assets/config.example.json).

## Running

```bash
node <path-to>/shot.cjs my-guide.json             # every shot
node <path-to>/shot.cjs my-guide.json 03 login    # only shots whose name contains "03" or "login"
node <path-to>/shot.cjs my-guide.json --check     # run the steps, save nothing
```

- Each shot prints `OK <file>` or `FAIL <name> - <reason>`. A failed shot does not stop the rest.
- Each `OK` line says whether the image is `new`, `changed`, or `unchanged` compared with the file it replaced, and the last line counts them. After a UI change, update only the changed images in your guide.
- A misspelled key prints a `WARN unknown key` line instead of being silently ignored.
- Exit code: `0` all shots OK, `1` at least one failed, `2` the dependency is not installed.
- `--check` runs every step but saves no images. Use it after a UI change, or in CI, to find broken selectors early.
- `"scale": 2` in the config gives double-resolution images that stay sharp in a PDF or on a HiDPI screen.
- Add `"headless": false` to the config to watch the browser while it works.

## Using it with an AI agent

GuShot is also an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io). Once installed, you ask the agent in plain words ("make screenshots of the login page and the dashboard for the user guide"). It reads your app's code to work out the login flow, writes the config, runs it, and checks the images.

The agent has to run commands on the same machine as your app, or one that can reach it. Agents that run in a cloud sandbox, such as a chat in the browser, cannot open your `localhost` and have no Chrome.

### Claude Code

Install it as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add rombyar/gushot
/plugin install gushot@gushot
```

Then, in your project: `/guide-screenshots capture the login page and the dashboard`.

### Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and others

Most agents load skills from a `skills` folder. Copy the `guide-screenshots` folder there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rombyar/gushot.git
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r gushot/skills/guide-screenshots ~/.agents/skills/
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/rombyar/gushot.git
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.agents\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse gushot\skills\guide-screenshots "$HOME\.agents\skills\"
```

`~/.agents/skills/` makes the skill available in all your projects. To share it with a team instead, copy it into `.agents/skills/` inside the project and commit it.

| Agent | Folder it reads (personal / project) | How to call the skill |
|---|---|---|
| [Codex](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) (CLI, IDE) | `~/.agents/skills/` / `.agents/skills/` | type `$guide-screenshots`, or just describe the task |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills) (VS Code agent mode) | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.copilot/skills/` / `.agents/skills/`, `.github/skills/` | type `/guide-screenshots` in chat |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills) | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/` / `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/` | type `/guide-screenshots` in Agent chat |
| [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/) | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.gemini/skills/` / `.agents/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/` | describe the task; Gemini asks to activate the skill |
| Claude Code without the plugin | `~/.claude/skills/` / `.claude/skills/` | type `/guide-screenshots` |

Gemini CLI can also install it straight from GitHub:

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/rombyar/gushot.git --path skills/guide-screenshots
```

For any other agent, check [the list of agents that support skills](https://agentskills.io) and its docs for the folder name. The skill folder has everything it needs; on the first run the agent installs its one dependency inside it.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Page has no styling | The app's own base URL setting (for example `APP_URL`) does not match `base` |
| `OTP not found` | The code went to a real email or SMS instead of the log file, or `pattern` does not match the log line |
| Shots show the login page | The login steps failed or the session cookie was not kept; check HTTP vs HTTPS and the cookie domain |
| `text "X" not found` | The element was not on screen yet; add `{ "wait": "<selector>" }` before the click |
| Half-finished animation in the image | Increase `delay` (default 500 ms) |
| `Chrome/Edge not found` | Set `CHROME_PATH` or `"chrome"` in the config to the browser's executable |

Use sample data from seeders, not real customer data. Blur anything personal anyway.

## Indonesian

Indonesian config keys (`buka`, `klik`, `sorot`, ...) work as aliases of the English ones, see [aliases-id.md](skills/guide-screenshots/references/aliases-id.md). `"lang": "id"` or `SHOT_LANG=id` switches the terminal messages to Indonesian.

## Contributing

```
skills/guide-screenshots/   the skill: SKILL.md, scripts/shot.cjs, references, example config
demo/                       demo app, its config, and the screenshots/video it produces
test/                       self-test (no server needed)
.claude-plugin/             Claude Code plugin manifests
```

Run the self-test before sending changes:

```bash
node test/run.cjs
```

It runs an English and an Indonesian config against a local page; each contains one failing shot and one misspelled key on purpose. CI runs the same test on every push. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the conventions and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for releases.
